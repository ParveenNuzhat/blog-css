          Web development trends in 2023 include an emphasis on responsive
          design, serverless architecture, optimized voice search, dark mode
          standardization, and increased focus on cybersecurity. Additionally,
          WordPress development is expected to continue to evolve and gain
          popularity as an open-source, user-friendly, and versatile platform
          for website building and management. Progressive Web App (PWA),
          Artificial Intelligence, and headless CMS are other trends that are
          expected to grow in popularity in 2023. All these trends are expected
          to improve the user experience, performance, and accessibility of
          websites and web applications, making them more efficient, engaging,
          and secure.
